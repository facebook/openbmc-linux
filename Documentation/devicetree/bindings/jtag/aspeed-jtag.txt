Aspeed JTAG driver for ast2400 and ast2500 SoC

Required properties:
- compatible:       Should be one of
      - "aspeed,ast2400-jtag"
      - "aspeed,ast2500-jtag"
- reg           contains the offset and length of the JTAG memory
            region
- clocks        root clock of bus, should reference the APB
            clock in the second cell
- resets        phandle to reset controller with the reset number in
            the second cell
- interrupts        should contain JTAG controller interrupt

Example:
jtag: jtag@1e6e4000 {
    compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-jtag";
    reg = <0x1e6e4000 0x1c>;
    clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_APB>;
    resets = <&syscon ASPEED_RESET_JTAG_MASTER>;
    interrupts = <43>;
};
