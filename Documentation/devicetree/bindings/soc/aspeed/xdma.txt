Aspeed AST25XX and AST26XX XDMA Engine

The XDMA Engine embedded in the AST2500 and AST2600 SOCs can perform automatic
DMA operations over PCI between the SOC (acting as a BMC) and a host processor.

Required properties:
 - compatible		: must be "aspeed,ast2500-xdma" or
			  "aspeed,ast2600-xdma"
 - reg			: contains the address and size of the memory region
			  associated with the XDMA engine registers
 - clocks		: clock specifier for the clock associated with the
			  XDMA engine
 - resets		: reset specifier for the syscon reset associated with
			  the XDMA engine
 - interrupts-extended	: two interrupt cells; the first specifies the global
			  interrupt for the XDMA engine and the second
			  specifies the PCI-E reset or PERST interrupt.
 - aspeed,scu		: a phandle to the syscon node for the system control
			  unit of the SOC
 - memory-region	: a phandle to the reserved memory region to be used by
			  the XDMA engine for DMA operations

Optional properties:
 - pcie-device		: should be either "bmc" or "vga", corresponding to
			  which device should be used by the XDMA engine for
			  DMA operations. If this property is not set, the XDMA
			  engine will use the BMC PCI-E device.

Example:

    xdma@1e6e7000 {
        compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-xdma";
        reg = <0x1e6e7000 0x100>;
        clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_GATE_BCLK>;
        resets = <&syscon ASPEED_RESET_XDMA>;
        interrupts-extended = <&vic 6>, <&scu_ic ASPEED_AST2500_SCU_IC_PCIE_RESET_LO_TO_HI>;
        aspeed,scu = <&syscon>;
        pcie-device = "bmc";
        memory-region = <&vga_memory>;
    };
