Device tree configuration for the I2C busses on the AST24XX and AST25XX SoCs.

Required Properties:
- #address-cells	: should be 1
- #size-cells		: should be 0
- reg			: address offset and range of bus registers and buffer
- reg-names		: "bus-regs" and "buf" are recognized by Aspeed I2C
			  driver. "bus-regs" is default. "buf" is optional in
			  case of enabling I2C dedicated SRAM for buffer mode
			  transfer support
- compatible		: should be "aspeed,ast2400-i2c-bus"
			  or "aspeed,ast2500-i2c-bus"
- clocks		: root clock of bus, should reference the APB
			  clock in the second cell
- resets		: phandle to reset controller with the reset number in
			  the second cell
- interrupts		: interrupt number

Optional Properties:
- bus-frequency	: frequency of the bus clock in Hz defaults to 100 kHz when not
		  specified
- multi-master	: states that there is another master active on this bus.
- aspeed,dma-buf-size	: should be 4096 in case of AST2500.
			  Only AST2500 supports DMA mode under some limitations:
			  I2C is sharing the DMA H/W with UHCI host controller
			  and MCTP controller. Since those controllers operate
			  with DMA mode only, I2C has to use buffer mode or byte
			  mode instead if one of those controllers is enabled.
			  Also make sure that if SD/eMMC or Port80 snoop uses
			  DMA mode instead of PIO or FIFO respectively, I2C
			  can't use DMA mode. IF both DMA and buffer modes are
			  enabled, DMA mode will be selected.
